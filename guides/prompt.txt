I want to create a small webapp
A user (content creator) will come to the app and give some details like his niche, etc
The app is supposed to show him real analytics of trends in the niche and templates for him to create short form content

The idea is that there will be 2 pages 
One will be the main page that is like a homepage where all the details will be collected as well
The other will be the analytics page where all the results are displayed

Both pages will be written in HTML, CSS, JS frontend
The backend will be fastapi based routes to for example the root for the main page and a /results path for the analytics and results page

The mechanism will be that there will be an .env file for the api key 
The results will be requested from that api key LLM service provider, for example gemini in this case
The request will include a highly sophisticated prompt fully engineered to make gemini search for real trends and returning the right data

This will be the goto platform for content creators to get analytics of real trends and some templates for their short form content

Go forward and code it. You are an experienced software engineer
