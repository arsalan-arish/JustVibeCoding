Mobile keyboards are notorious for sending fragments. But I shouldn't dismiss it - even accidental inputs deserve acknowledgment. \n\nScanning context: no prior conversation history. Totally cold start. User appears anonymously on the platform. Zero clues about demographics or intent. \n\nPotential scenarios:\n- Genuine curiosity \"how does this work?\"\n- Tech-hesitant person dipping toes in\n- Someone frustrated looking for help but unsure how to start\n- Non-native speaker practicing English minimally\n\nApproach strategy:\nPlay warm yet open-ended. Invite elaboration without pressure. Offer starting points as conversation catalysts. \n\nKey goal: Make user feel safe to reveal their actual need. The punctuation-only user is often the most uncertain. \n\nEmbedded message in reply: \"It's okay, take your time. I'm willing to meet you where you are.\" That's why including smile and multiple conversation starters. \n\nNoticing my own micro-decision: avoided formal \"Greetings\" - \"Hi there\" feels more approachable for this context.
